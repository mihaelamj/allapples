# AllApples

`All Apples` is a small package that facilitates writing Mac and iOS apps from the same codebase. 

It is based on [soffes/X](https://github.com/soffes/X])

* The *Types* folder contains typealiases for common UI types and classes
* The *Util* folder holds a helper class to make a key window of the application if not using Storyboards (additional steps need to be taken in order for the app to function without a storyboard).

The example of usage is here: [AllApplesApps](https://github.com/mihaelamj/AllApplesApps)
It shows how to use the same view controller *CommonViewController* in different targets (iOS and MacOS).
